Made by Sam Humphreys using React

## Summary

A fairly simple clock built with React, designed to work with your browser in full screen mode.

The burger menu allows you to select how often the bell chime sounds: not at all, or every 15, 30 or 60 minutes.

## Installation

Note: These instructions are written for use in a terminal on a unix-like machine...

* Go to the directory where you want to create the clock subfolder

* Clone the directory from Bitbucket

`git clone https://[your Bitbucket user name]@bitbucket.org/iamasamwich/clock.git`

* When the download has finished, change into the directory and install the NPM packages

`cd clock && npm install`

* When the packages have installed start the server

`npm start`

* When you have finished Ctrl + C to stop the server
