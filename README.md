Made by Sam Humphreys using React

## Summary

A fairly simple clock built with React, designed to work with your browser in full screen mode.

The burger menu allows you to select how often the bell chime sounds: not at all, or every 15, 30 or 60 minutes.

## To-do

* Add responsive styling
* Add a stopwatch function for tracking time spent on a task
* <s>Add a menu with option to add a setting to ding periodically with 15 minute, 30 minute and 1 hour intervals.</s>
* <s>Save dinger preferences in local storage</s>
